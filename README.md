# Stealing NYC Planning Labs' Website

This repo houses a fork of the NYC Planning Labs Jekyll blog/website, for experimentation, and possible adoption as the McKinely Park Development Council Website.

### Jekyll Foundation

This package is based on [Jekyll Foundation](https://github.com/core77/jekyll-foundation/), which lets you quickstart your Jekyll (v3) project with Zurb Foundation for Sites (v6, sass).
